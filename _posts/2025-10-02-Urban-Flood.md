## The Growing Threat of Urban Flooding

With climate change intensifying the frequency of extreme rainfall events, urban flooding has become one of the most disruptive hazards to public safety and infrastructure. Traditional flood control systems focus on response rather than anticipation, lacking the real-time intelligence needed for fast-moving storm events.

## The “Four-Pre” Concept

Hydro Intelligence LLC’s flood management solution adopts the Four-Pre Framework—Prevention, Pre-warning, Pre-action, and Pre-evaluation—to build a closed-loop, adaptive flood resilience system.

Prevention emphasizes preparedness: mapping flood-prone areas, simulating scenarios, and designing storage or diversion strategies.

Pre-warning leverages radar rainfall monitoring, IoT water-level sensors, and hydrodynamic modeling to predict inundation in real time.

Pre-action triggers automated responses such as pump activation, sluice control, or emergency routing based on forecast thresholds.

Pre-evaluation analyzes post-event data to assess effectiveness and refine models for future events.

## Technology and Data Integration

The system integrates multi-source data—rainfall, topography, drainage network status, and field video feeds—into a unified command dashboard. AI algorithms evaluate evolving risk in each sub-catchment and dynamically update response recommendations.
Operators and city managers can visualize ongoing flood scenarios, receive graded alerts, and coordinate field operations through mobile and web-based platforms.

## Achievements and Future Outlook

The Four-Pre system converts flood management from reactive crisis response into predictive risk governance. It reduces damage to property, protects critical infrastructure, and saves lives.
Cities adopting this approach experience improved emergency coordination, higher public awareness, and measurable resilience gains.
As climate extremes continue to evolve, Hydro Intelligence LLC’s intelligent flood management platform provides a scalable, adaptive foundation for building truly climate-resilient cities.
