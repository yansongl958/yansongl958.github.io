## Background and Challenges

Water loss, often referred to as Non-Revenue Water (NRW), continues to be one of the most pressing global issues for utilities. Aging infrastructure, hidden leaks, and unbalanced pressure zones result in significant economic loss and wasted energy. Conventional leak detection approaches rely heavily on manual inspections or consumer reports, leading to delayed responses and inefficient operations.

## Hydro Intelligence’s Approach

Hydro Intelligence LLC introduces a data-driven leakage control framework that integrates intelligent pressure optimization with District Metered Area (DMA) zoning. The system divides the distribution network into manageable DMAs, each monitored by smart meters, flow sensors, and pressure loggers. Real-time data streams are collected and analyzed through AI algorithms that detect subtle pressure deviations and flow anomalies.
Once irregular patterns are identified, the platform automatically isolates potential leak areas and provides prioritized maintenance recommendations.

## Dynamic Pressure Management

Pressure optimization is at the heart of effective leakage control. Excessive or unstable pressure is the root cause of burst events and background leakage. Our system uses adaptive pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) and predictive control logic to regulate network pressure according to consumption demand and time of day. This dynamic control minimizes hydraulic shocks, stabilizes service levels, and reduces pumping energy by up to 15%.

## Benefits and Results

By combining DMA analytics with intelligent pressure regulation, utilities achieve proactive leakage prevention rather than reactive repair. The system’s continuous learning mechanism refines algorithms based on seasonal variation, network rehabilitation, and customer feedback.
Field applications have demonstrated 10–30% NRW reduction, extended asset lifetimes, and substantial savings in operation and maintenance costs—all while ensuring service reliability and customer satisfaction.
