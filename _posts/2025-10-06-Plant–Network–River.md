## Current Challenges

Urban drainage and wastewater systems are inherently interconnected, yet operationally fragmented. Treatment plants, conveyance networks, and receiving rivers often function independently, resulting in inefficiencies, overflow risks, and higher operational costs. Without holistic coordination, it is difficult to balance treatment capacity, hydraulic loading, and environmental compliance.

## System Architecture

The PNR Integrated Scheduling System developed by Hydro Intelligence LLC bridges this gap through unified data integration and model-based decision support.
The platform aggregates data from SCADA systems, GIS hydraulic models, and meteorological forecasts to form a dynamic digital twin. It continuously simulates the interactions between plants, networks, and rivers to predict flow variations, pollutant transport, and hydraulic capacity in real time.

## Intelligent Optimization and Coordination

Using AI-assisted optimization algorithms, the PNR scheduler analyzes multiple operational objectives—such as minimizing overflow, balancing storage utilization, and reducing energy consumption. During storm events, it forecasts inflows and proactively adjusts pumping, gate operations, and retention storage. In dry periods, it optimizes plant loading, aeration control, and chemical dosing to maintain energy efficiency.

## Outcomes and Strategic Value

This integrated operation transforms utilities from reactive responders to proactive system managers. It enhances environmental compliance, improves effluent quality, and reduces overflow incidents.
More importantly, the PNR framework serves as the foundation for smart watershed management, aligning with “Sponge City” and “Resilient City” initiatives worldwide.
Through unified control and predictive analytics, Hydro Intelligence LLC enables cities to achieve safer, cleaner, and more sustainable water environments.
